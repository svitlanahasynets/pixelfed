### Added
- Add COSTAR - Confirm Object Sentiment Transform and Reduce

COSTAR is a filtering system that allows admins to define environment variables that will dynamically apply certain policies to posts of a defined scope, similar to Pleroma's MRF system.

Scopes:
- Domain: apply to posts from a specific website
- Actor: apply to posts from a specific profile/user
- Keyword: apply to posts containing a specific string

Policies:
- Block: Default blocks the defined scope
- CW: Automatically rewrites the scope to apply a warning
- Unlist: Removes the scope from public timelines
